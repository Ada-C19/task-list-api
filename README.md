# Task List API


<h2>Skills Assessed</h2>
Following directions and reading comprehension</br>
Reading, writing, and using tests</br>
Demonstrating understanding of the client-server model, request-response cycle and conventional RESTful routes</br>
Driving development with independent research, experimentation, and collaboration</br>
Reading and using existing external web APIs</br>
Using Postman as part of the development workflow</br>
Using git as part of the development workflow</br>

<h2>Working with the Flask package:</h2>

Creating models</br>
Creating conventional RESTful CRUD routes for a model</br>
Reading query parameters to create custom behavior</br>
Create unconventional routes for custom behavior</br>
Apply knowledge about making requests in Python, to call an API inside of an API</br>
Apply knowledge about environment variables</br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!
</br></br>
If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!
</br></br>
We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:</br>

Sort tasks</br>
Mark them as complete</br>
Get feedback about our task list through Slack</br>
Organize tasks with goals</br>
... and more!</br>

<h3>How to Complete and Submit</h3>
Go through the waves one-by-one and build the features of this API.
</br></br>
At submission time, no matter where you are, submit the project via Learn.
</br></br>
<h3>Project Directions</h3>
This project is designed to fulfill the features described in detail in each wave. The tests are meant to only guide your development.
